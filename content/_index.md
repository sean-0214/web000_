      subtitle: 'Quantitative Finance & Machine Learning'
      text: |-
        I focus on applying machine learning and data science techniques to discover investment opportunities and develop risk management strategies in the field of quantitative finance.
        
        My research interests include:
        - Algorithmic trading strategy development
        - Quantitative risk modeling and portfolio optimization
        - Application of machine learning to financial time series
        - Derivatives pricing and structured product analysis
        
        As evidenced by my participation in competitions like the International Quant Championship and Point 72 x Fidelity Competition, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of quantitative analysis.
